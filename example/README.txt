We did all 75 points stages.
+ Ask player name and use it for end of the game.
+ We increased the maze size to "cell_size = 27".
+ Number of apples +1 and bad_turtles +1 .
+ Add an energy bar depends on time. if The energy bar becomes 0, the mario live will be -1 .
+ At the end of the game, press 'q' to exit screen.
+ Add sounds for each events.For instance, mario eats apples, bad_turtles eat mario, game_won, game_lost, quit_game.
+ Bad_turtle's colors are also random.
+ We tried to pause the game but mario is only stopped.


->Sometimes our game can get ERROR because of PyScripter.If you have a kind of error,please try again.
